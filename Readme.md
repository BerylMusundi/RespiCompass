## Rationale 
With many uncertain factors at play, it is challenging to predict how respiratory viruses will spread during the winter season. However, by combining data from national surveillance systems with published scientific evidence, expert knowledge, and leveraging expertise from global modelling groups, this respiratory disease scenario modelling hub provides public health advisors and policy decision-makers at European, national, or subnational level with the best available information on plausible winter season scenarios. This hub will provide guidance—a "compass"—to support public health stakeholders in their long-term planning and anticipatory action. Secondly, such a hub builds a synergistic community of policy advisors, policy makers and modellers and brings modelling closer to decision making.

## How to Join RespiCompass
RespiCompass welcomes teams willing to contribute their projections. Detailed information on how to join are provided in the [Wiki](https://github.com/european-modelling-hubs/RespiCompass/wiki). Here’s a concise guide on how to participate:

1. **Create a Metadata File**:
   - Include key information about your team and model.
   - Detailed instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/european-modelling-hubs/RespiCompass/wiki/Metadata).

2. **Develop Your Model**:
   - Independently develop your model and produce projections.
   - Ensure your projections respect the provided scenario assumptions (refer to specific rounds information).

3. **Submit Model Projections**:
   - Follow the submission format detailed [here](https://github.com/european-modelling-hubs/RespiCompass/wiki/Submission-format).
   - Submit your projections via a pull request as outlined [here](https://github.com/european-modelling-hubs/RespiCompass/wiki/Submitting-using-GitHub-Website).
